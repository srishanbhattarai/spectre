# Spectre

Spectre describes a family of vulnerabilities that arise due to problems with [speculative execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution) in modern processors.

This repository functions as distillation of the original [paper](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf) that describes the attacks, as well a source of information
about how modern processors are implemented, eventually leading up to the Spectre attacks.
